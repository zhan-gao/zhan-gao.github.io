🎓 I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/econ/about-us/), where I have the privilege of being advised by Professor [Hyungsik Roger Moon](https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/moonr). Before coming to LA, I received M.Phil in Economics (18') and B.Sc. in Mathematics (16') from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Zhentao Shi](http://zhentaoshi.github.io/).

📝 *<u>I will be on the academic job market 2024-25 and available for interviews</u>*. Please see my [Curriculum Vitae](./cv.pdf) and [Research Profile](/research) for more information.

📖 My research interests lie in both econometric theory and applied econometrics.  I specialize in high-dimensional methods in time series and panel data models. I also have broad interests and have done works in empirical asset pricing, labor/personnel economics, economics of digital platforms, AI, and interdisciplinary research joint with the biostatistics and communications communities.
